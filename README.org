# TODO Complete this!

* General 
  Maki is controlled by an [[https://learn.trossenrobotics.com/arbotix/7-arbotix-quick-start-guide][ArbotiX-M]] microcontroller. The maki_controller subdir contains the driver source code and other relevant files, but any changes must be uploaded via Arduino's IDE.  
* Prereqs
  You may need to add your user to the dialout group to send commands to Maki:
  
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  sudo gpasswd --add ${USER} dialout
#+END_SRC
 
* Test behaviors
   Make sure to osurce setup.bash in terminal first.

 #+BEGIN_SRC shell
   source ~/catkin_ws/deve/setup.bash
 #+END_SRC

  To test some basic Maki behaviors (blinking and head nod) first launch a roscore instance:
 #+BEGIN_SRC shell
   roscore
 #+END_SRC
 
And then in a separate terminal run: 
 #+BEGIN_SRC shell
   roslaunch maki_robot test_behaviors.launch
 #+END_SRC
